# Machine Learning Fall 25 Project
### Team 35 - Predicting the next big artists on Spotify


## 📁 File Descriptions:
- `/docs/`: Manages web/jekyll page files.
- `next-up-predictor`: Will be used as our main file for data loading, processing, feature reduction, and algorithm application and analysis for the Final report. Currently is a framework for this.
- `linear-regression.ipynb`: Uses framework from `next-up-predictor` and adds on an application of Linear Regression. Included is additional preprocessing, model setup, training, testing, and visualizations.
- `random-forest.ipynb`: Uses framework from `next-up-predictor` and adds on an application of Random Forest. Included is additional preprocessing, model setup, prediction, improvement, and visualizations.
- `knn.ipynb`: Uses framework from `next-up-predictor` and adds on an application of K Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Included is additional preprocessing, model setup, prediction, hyperparameter tuning improvement, and visualizations.
- `clustering.ipynb`: Uses framework from `next-up-predictor` and adds on an application of K Means and GMM clustering. Included is additional preprocessing, model setup, prediction, hyperparameter tuning, improvement, and visualizations.
- `requirements.txt`: The list of Python libraries needed to run every file in the project.`

## 🔧 Setup:
1. Create new `.venv` on Python 3.12.*
2. In a new terminal with the environment activated, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run any file from the following list:
   - `next-up-predictor`
   - `linear-regression`
   - `random-forest`
